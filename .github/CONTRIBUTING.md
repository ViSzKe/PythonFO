# Functionality
* Code changes may only be committed if the project is in a functional state.

# Versioning
* During development between official releases, all version numbers in the codebase (including `README` and the CLI welcome message) must be set to `v0.0.0` as a placeholder, and must only be updated to the official release version in the final commit before merging.
* Any indicators of the software life cycle (e.g. *alpha*, *beta*, *stable/production*) must also be removed during development and reinserted in the final commit before merging.
